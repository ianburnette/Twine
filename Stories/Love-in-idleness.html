You sway unsteadily. Looking around, you see that you&#x27;re in Communications.
That&#x27;s not good. This end of the ship is a dead end. You can reach a few rooms from Communications, but the only way back to the rest of the ship - and the armory and the escape pods - is the way you came. 
And you have a feeling the monster in the hallway might have a thing or two to say about that.]
(if: $rooms_visited is 1)[
You&#x27;re back in Communications. The door locks behind you.
The banging continues. The creature&#x27;s still out there. Can&#x27;t imagine why it&#x27;s so relentless. It already ate the rest of your crew, and it&#x27;s not much bigger than a human. Surely it can&#x27;t still be hungry ... 
In any case, you don&#x27;t have much time. The door to the hall is holding, but not for long. Only enough time to visit each of the other rooms once, you estimate.]
(if: $rooms_visited is 2)[
You&#x27;re back in Communications. The door locks behind you.
The door to the hallway is riddled with dents from the creature&#x27;s pounding claws. You can see the hinges straining. Just enough time to visit the last room.]
	(if: $rooms_visited is 3)[
The final door hisses shut behind you. The creature&#x27;s relentless pounding has bent the edges of the door back, and you can see its glowing eyes through the cracks. 
You only have a few moments to [[prepare.|Prepare]]]

Okay, not entirely senseless, because you are aware enough to hear the beast scream with rage from behind the door. It occurs to you that could&#x27;ve never hoped to barricade it in time, but the creature&#x27;s body mass and momentum was enough to trap it on the other side.

The metallic thuds reverberate through the empty, cold corridors of your ship and rattle around your dazed brain like a couple of bowling balls in a metal barrel. Judging by the dents forming in the door, you only have a few minutes before it breaks through.

A pipe is running from it to a vent above the hallway door. There&#x27;s a small panel on the tank labeled &quot;Emergency Input.&quot; 

There&#x27;s an empty spacesuit lying on the floor. It would take too long to put on, and wouldn&#x27;t really offer much additional protection anyway. After all, it&#x27;s a space suit, not a monster suit. Although a monster suit would be pretty neat. The monster would get super confused before, you know, killing you. 

There are several large holographic stations with chairs next to them. 

And, of course, there&#x27;s the closed, dented door back to the hallway, which is rapidly getting more dented.
