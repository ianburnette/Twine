There&#x27;s an empty spacesuit lying on the floor. It would take too long to put on, and wouldn&#x27;t really offer much additional protection anyway.

There are several large holographic stations with chairs next to them.

It&#x27;s like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen, that&#x27;s for sure. Some native of this backwater, isolated planet. But with that tempest of a solar storm, you had no choice but to put the ship down here. 

A solar storm can do a lot of things: fry you with radiation, knock out your ship&#x27;s systems, even cause your ship to depressurize and collapse. 

There&#x27;s one thing solar flares //don&#x27;t// do, though: they don&#x27;t tear your face off and eat you. Considering the state of the rest of the crew, maybe you should&#x27;ve taken your chances with the solar storm.
